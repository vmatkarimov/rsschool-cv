## About me:

I was fond of programming at school, I started studying with the Basic language.

At the moment I manage projects remotely, before that I was engaged in development: game projects in small teams, then I went to freelance, the projects were different. My goal is to bring back forgotten development skills and gain new knowledge through intensive practice. Accidentally found out RS School and immediately entered the course.

For the last 3 years, basically, I havenâ€™t written any code only review, it takes time for me to recover. I developed games in Actionscript 3 and in freelancing the main language was JS with different projects.

## Code examples:
```
multiply = function (a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```



## Education:
Secondary.

## English:
I read any documentation in English, practically without a dictionary, I understand speech by ear and can even support the conversation a little. I had little experience in Europe (half a year) the main language for communication in the team was English.
